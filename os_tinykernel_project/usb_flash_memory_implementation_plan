 *  Initialize the controller

After finding the controller, you have to initialize it. Implementations may vary from OS to OS, but the basic line is the same.

    Enable Bus Master and Memory Space
    Save Base Address
    Save Operational Base Address
    Save Extended Capabilities Pointer
    Check if Extended Capabilities Pointer < 40; if true, skip this step
        Check if BIOS owns the controller; if true, get ownership
    Stop and reset the controller (but not start)
    Setup Queue Head
    Start the controller

Find devices

    Scan USB ports for connected devices; if false, go to next port
    Check if low speed; if true, go to next port (mass-storage devices are hi-speed)
    Reset and enable the port which contains the device.

Prepare devices

    Get device-configuration-interface-endpoint descriptors.
        Check if the device is mass-storage class
        Check if the device responds to SCSI commands
        Check if the protocol is Bulk-Only
        If all above true, proceed
    Assign unique USB address and use it from now
    Assign device configuration (usually got from configuration descriptor)
    Get and use endpoints from endpoint descriptor
    Send Inquiry Command
    Send Test Unit Ready Command
    Send Read Capacity Command
