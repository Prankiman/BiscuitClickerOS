Data Toggle Info
********************

DATA0=0, DATA1=1
this can really mess up your usb transactions if not done correctly

Here are some rules as I see them:

1) each endpoint maintains its own toggle which alternates between 0 and 1 with each TD

2) on reset host and device set there toggles to 0

3) control transfers have rigid rules for toggle:
	* command transport = first TD uses DATA0 then alternates
	* data transport    = first TD uses DATA1 then alternates
	* status transport  = first TD uses DATA1 then alternates

4) for bulk transfers you must use a global dataIN and dataOUT variable and alternate
this even across transactions and phases. 
i.e. if the previous status transport was an IN=1 then 
the next data transport if IN must be 0

5) if NAK do not toggle, instead retry with same

tatOS is very dumb about usb error checking.  Future versions may include more.
For now you can view the status of each TD in the "dump".
If communication between the controller and your device gets screwed up
we have no option other than to reset the port and device and start over (shell F12). 
At least you have manual control to do this without the need to reboot. 
In general my usb transactions complete 100% without problems. This is likely because 
I dont put much demand on the bus (i.e. Im not streaming audio, shaking the mouse and 
reading my flash drive all at the same time).
